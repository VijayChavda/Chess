Something (very embarrassing) I made in high school which I'm proud of :)

It was 2010 and our computer period just got converted to games period (yaay! school days). I stayed in the lab with my friend Ravi, and I was looking for some game to play. And there I saw some blue colored cube on the desktop, and thinking it's a game, I opened it. As Netbeans opened up, I saw some ugly looking program inside that program (the GUI designer). I tried to click the buttons but instead they moved and I was able to change it's text. Then I saw something called pallet on the right side, and I thought, it's just like MS Paint! But you create software instead of paintings, wow! So this is how it's made! (I got scared when I double-clicked a button, I immediately closed everything)

Soon Netbeans became my favourite tool (I still prefer it) and I started playing with it. Me and my friend Ravi, we both started this wonderful journey full of learning experience, where we started with "Hello World" and ended up making amazing 2D games. In the beginning we had no idea what a class/interface/method was, having just some idea about C syntax, all we knew that we should avoid red/yellow lines below our code. And simply reading the docs (even though nothing made sense) and experimenting with trials & errors, we brought eachother farther than we could have imagined.

This software means a lot to me, it is one of the instance where the coder inside me was born. It's extreamly inefficient and buggy, but hey, it's like my first child and I love it anyways :P
